                        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

                        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

                        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        1. Definitions.

                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                        
                        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS]]>

                        1. Definitions.
                        
                        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
                        
                        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.
                        
                        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
                        
                        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
                        
                        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
                        
                        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
                        
                        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                        
                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                        
                        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS]]>

                        1. Definitions.
                        
                        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
                        
                        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.
                        
                        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
                        
                        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                        
                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                        
                        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS]]>

                        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
                        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
                        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                        
                        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS]]>

                        conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
                        original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
                        and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
                        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
                        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
                        
                        Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
                        intended for use by those authorized to give the public
                        permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
                        copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
                        irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
                        and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
                        Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
                        applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
                        material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
                        material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
                        licensed material, or material used under an exception or
                        limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

                        Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
                        licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
                        licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
                        the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
                        example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
                        copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
                        licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
                        other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
                        the licensed material may still be restricted for other
                        reasons, including because others have copyright or other
                        rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
                        such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
                        Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
                        respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

                        specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
                        Rights.

                        e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
                        any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights

                        dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
                        available to the public including in ways that members of the
                        public may access the material from a place and at a time
                        individually chosen by them.

                        resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

                        Section 2 -- Scope.
                        
                        a. License grant.
                        
                        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                        the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                        exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
                        
                        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                        in part; and

                        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                        Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                        License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                        its terms and conditions.
                        
                        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                        6(a).
                        
                        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                        Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                        all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                        and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                        Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                        authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                        necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                        technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                        Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                        simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                        (4) never produces Adapted Material.
                        
                        5. Downstream recipients.
                        
                        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                        recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                        receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                        Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                        Public License.
                        
                        b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                        any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                        apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                        Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                        Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                        Material.
                        
                        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                        may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                        are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                        with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                        the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                        provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
                        
                        b. Other rights.
                        
                        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                        licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                        privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                        the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                        assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                        extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                        Rights, but not otherwise.
                        
                        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                        Public License.
                        
                        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                        collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                        Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                        under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                        licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                        reserves any right to collect such royalties.
                        
                        
                        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
                        
                        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
                        following conditions.
                        
                        a. Attribution.
                        
                        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
                        form), You must:
                        
                        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                        with the Licensed Material:
                        
                        i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                        Material and any others designated to receive
                        attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                        the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                        designated);
                        
                        ii. a copyright notice;

                        extent reasonably practicable;
                        
                        b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                        retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
                        
                        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                        Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                        hyperlink to, this Public License.
                        
                        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                        reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                        which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                        reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                        hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                        information.

                        information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                        reasonably practicable.
                        
                        4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
                        License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
                        Material from complying with this Public License.
                        
                        
                        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
                        
                        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
                        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
                        
                        a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
                        to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
                        portion of the contents of the database;
                        
                        b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
                        contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
                        Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
                        Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
                        
                        c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
                        all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
                        
                        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
                        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
                        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
                        
                        
                        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
                        
                        a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
                        EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
                        AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
                        ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
                        IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                        WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                        PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
                        ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
                        KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
                        ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
                        
                        b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
                        TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                        NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
                        INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
                        COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
                        USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
                        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
                        DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
                        IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
                        
                        c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
                        above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
                        possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
                        waiver of all liability.
                        
                        
                        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
                        
                        a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
                        Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
                        this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
                        terminate automatically.
                        
                        b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
                        Section 6(a), it reinstates:
                        
                        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                        it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
                        violation; or
                        
                        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
                        
                        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
                        right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
                        of this Public License.
                        
                        c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
                        Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
                        distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
                        will not terminate this Public License.
                        
                        d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
                        License.
                        
                        
                        Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
                        
                        a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
                        terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
                        
                        b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
                        Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
                        independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
                        
                        
                        Section 8 -- Interpretation.
                        
                        a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
                        shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
                        conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
                        be made without permission under this Public License.
                        
                        b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
                        deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
                        minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
                        cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
                        without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
                        conditions.
                        
                        c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
                        failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
                        Licensor.
                        
                        d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
                        as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
                        that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
                        processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable

                        discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is
                        conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
                        owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
                        behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

                        2. Grant of Copyright License.
                        
                        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
                        hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                        royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
                        Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
                        and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in
                        Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License.
                        
                        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
                        hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                        royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
                        license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
                        otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
                        patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
                        infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
                        Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
                        If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
                        Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
                        contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
                        You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
                        litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution.
                        
                        You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
                        thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
                        Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                        
                        1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
                        copy of this License; and
                        
                        2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
                        that You changed the files; and
                        
                        3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
                        distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
                        the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain
                        to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
                        then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
                        of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
                        those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works,
                        in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
                        distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
                        display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
                        third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
                        for informational purposes only and do not modify the License.
                        You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
                        distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
                        provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
                        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
                        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
                        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
                        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
                        stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions.
                        
                        Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
                        submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
                        the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
                        terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
                        supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may

                        Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor

                        In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
                        (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
                        applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
                        to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
                        including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
                        damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
                        the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
                        for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
                        or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
                        Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

                        to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                        indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
                        this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
                        other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
                        each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
                        asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
                        warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate
                        notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
                        identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be
                        enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also
                        recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included
                        on the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

                        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

                        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                        
                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

                        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        The Artistic License 2.0
                        
                        Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
                        
                        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                        
                        Preamble
                        
                        This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
                        Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
                        The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
                        control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
                        Package available as open source and free software.
                        
                        You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
                        license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
                        terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
                        make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
                        a different licensing arrangement.
                        
                        Definitions
                        
                        "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
                        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
                        
                        "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
                        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
                        procedures.
                        
                        "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
                        distribute, or modify the Package.
                        
                        "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
                        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
                        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
                        Version, or a Modified Version.
                        
                        "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
                        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
                        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
                        
                        "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
                        this Package or providing support for this Package to another
                        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
                        
                        "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
                        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
                        by the Copyright Holder.
                        
                        "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
                        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
                        Holder.
                        
                        "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
                        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
                        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
                        
                        "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
                        configuration files for the Package.
                        
                        "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
                        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
                        translation of the Source form.
                        
                        
                        Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
                        
                        (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
                        Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
                        you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
                        
                        
                        Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
                        
                        (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
                        Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
                        either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
                        all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
                        your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
                        Compiled form of the Package.
                        
                        (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
                        modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
                        Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
                        will be subject to the Original License.
                        
                        
                        Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
                        
                        (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
                        or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
                        Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
                        from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
                        any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
                        you do at least ONE of the following:
                        
                        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
                        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
                        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
                        Version.
                        
                        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
                        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
                        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
                        from the name of the Standard Version.
                        
                        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
                        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
                        under
                        
                        (i)  the Original License or
                        
                        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
                        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
                        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
                        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
                        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
                        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
                        Fees are allowed.
                        
                        
                        Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
                        or Modified Versions without the Source
                        
                        (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
                        the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
                        get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
                        valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
                        time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
                        must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
                        If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
                        days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
                        you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
                        
                        (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
                        the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
                        the Source of the Modified Version.
                        
                        
                        Aggregating or Linking the Package
                        
                        (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
                        Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
                        aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
                        Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
                        components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
                        apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
                        as included in the aggregation.
                        
                        (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
                        other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
                        build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
                        include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
                        provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
                        
                        
                        Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
                        
                        (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
                        merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
                        the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
                        considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
                        terms of this license.
                        
                        
                        General Provisions
                        
                        (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
                        Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
                        modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
                        use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
                        license.
                        
                        (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
                        Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
                        to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
                        this license.
                        
                        (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
                        service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
                        
                        (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
                        free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
                        sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
                        patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
                        infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
                        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
                        that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
                        infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
                        date that such litigation is filed.
                        
                        (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
                        THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
                        IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
                        WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
                        NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
                        LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
                        BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
                        DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
                        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

                        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
                        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
                        and conversions to other media types.
                        
                        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
                        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
                        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
                        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                        
                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
                        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
                        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

                        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.
                        
                        Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}

                        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
                        source, and configuration files.
                        
                        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

                        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                        
                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

                        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                        
                        Preamble
                        
                        This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
                        Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
                        The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
                        control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
                        Package available as open source and free software.
                        
                        You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
                        license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
                        terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
                        make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
                        a different licensing arrangement.
                        
                        Definitions
                        
                        "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
                        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
                        
                        "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
                        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
                        procedures.
                        
                        "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
                        distribute, or modify the Package.
                        
                        "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
                        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
                        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
                        Version, or a Modified Version.
                        
                        "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
                        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
                        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
                        
                        "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
                        this Package or providing support for this Package to another
                        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
                        
                        "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
                        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
                        by the Copyright Holder.
                        
                        "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
                        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
                        Holder.
                        
                        "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
                        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
                        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
                        
                        "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
                        configuration files for the Package.
                        
                        "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
                        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
                        translation of the Source form.
                        
                        Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
                        
                        (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
                        Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
                        you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
                        
                        Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
                        
                        (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
                        Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
                        either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
                        all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
                        your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
                        Compiled form of the Package.
                        
                        (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
                        modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
                        Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
                        will be subject to the Original License.
                        
                        Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
                        
                        (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
                        or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
                        Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
                        from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
                        any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
                        you do at least ONE of the following:
                        
                        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
                        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
                        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
                        Version.
                        
                        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
                        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
                        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
                        from the name of the Standard Version.
                        
                        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
                        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
                        under
                        
                        (i)  the Original License or
                        
                        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
                        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
                        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
                        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
                        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
                        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
                        Fees are allowed.
                        
                        Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
                        or Modified Versions without the Source
                        
                        (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
                        the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
                        get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
                        valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
                        time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
                        must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
                        If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
                        days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
                        you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
                        
                        (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
                        the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
                        the Source of the Modified Version.
                        
                        Aggregating or Linking the Package
                        
                        (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
                        Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
                        aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
                        Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
                        components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
                        apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
                        as included in the aggregation.
                        
                        (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
                        other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
                        build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
                        include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
                        provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
                        
                        Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
                        
                        (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
                        merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
                        the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
                        considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
                        terms of this license.
                        
                        General Provisions
                        
                        (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
                        Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
                        modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
                        use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
                        license.
                        
                        (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
                        Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
                        to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
                        this license.
                        
                        (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
                        service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
                        
                        (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
                        free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
                        sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
                        patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
                        infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
                        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
                        that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
                        infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
                        date that such litigation is filed.
                        
                        (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:

                        LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL

                        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.
                        
                        Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}

                        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a

                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
